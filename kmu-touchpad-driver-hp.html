I had previously installed the windows precision drivers over my synaptics touchpad and everything worked perfectly until I turned on my laptop today and the touchpad doesn't work at all. I tried uninstalling the touchpad drivers and they still don't work. I had this exact same issue last year in January, but I couldn't solve it without completely resetting my laptop. Is there any way I can fix this without completely resetting my computer again. Здесь Вы можете бесплатно скачать драйвер для ноутбука HP Compaq Presario CQ57. Скачать драйвера на веб камеру. I don't believe this is a hardware issue because it is brand new. I saw somewhere about updating the drivers to another version to get Windows Precision Touchpad, which was apparently better. Not only did that driver not work, but I've tried a million other drivers, including the ones literally provided on the HP drivers page , and now the touchpad refuses to work. I've tried uninstalling the drivers and rebooting and let Windows figure itself out, and it somewhat did. The touchpad worked.

I'm pretty new to SCCM, so forgive me for asking what may be a very simple question. I'm trying to figure out the best way to push out a driver update for the Synaptics touchpad to our fleet of HP notebooks. No SCUP because at best I've heard mixed responses to it.

So I've had my 2017 13 inch x360 that I use for college work since early June. Everything has been going well with my device until now. I booted up my computer and all of a sudden my touchpad no longer functions. I tried reinstalling the driver, contacted support, had them try and solve the issue but nothing worked. So the computer is to be sent off for repairs. However living in Florida with Irma on the way, this could take a lot longer than the advertised 7 days. 
The touchpad stops working suddenly and to get it to work again i have to uninstall the driver. when i uninstall the driver it works fine, but i wont have the scroll features and etc. But the driver automatically install itself again on the pc. when the driver is installed it works as is should until, it just stops working. dose anyone know how to fix this driver error or disable the auto install. I was watching a tv show in Chrome and all of a sudden I got an BSOD, however it was in orange. I've never seen this before so I wasn't thinking clearly and didn't pickup any of the important text or QR code and had to shut my laptop off. I've recently installed new windows updates, but does this have anything to do with getting this error? Is there a file or location I can check where it will explain what caused this crash? edit: only thing I've done today was install a few new programs (thing. I followed the guide exactly, but every time I try to update or roll back the video card driver I get a BSOD. The keyboard also does not work with the supplied drivers applied to the correct Hardware ID through device manager and, finally, there is no trackpad device to apply the drivers to. Barring any other insight, I suppose I will just attempt to reinstall Windows. Thanks for any guidance as I need this thing for class tomorrow. So yesterday my laptop worked fine, been in Windows 10 for over a month now. I upgraded a month after purchasing my 00 Envy 6. Good specs, etc. This morning out of nowhere, my touchpad stops working. In fact my entire touchpad seems to be removed from my entire computer out of nowhere. Here's the kicker: After talking to HP support for over an hour, they tried reinstalling the drivers etc. and then said they are gonna pass it down to their case manager. The rep kept telling me I installed. As the title states, I updated my driver recently, because the pad was glitchy and the popup suggested I needed updating. So, updated, rebooted, and now the light that normally suggested the pad was locked stays on. And vice versa, the light goes off when the pad is locked. Suggestions? Solutions. My mom has a HP Pavilion DV5, and with the touchpad driver that HP installs with their bloatware you could double tap the top left corner of the touchpad to turn it off. I reinstalled Windows 7 64bit, and I noticed Synaptics doesn't have the double tap feature. Does anyone know where I can get HP's driver. Introduction My last laptop is an old HP Pavillion 14 with 4210u and 840m, loved that tough laptop because it simply wont break. But as a monster hunter fan, the news of their newest game, monster hunter world coming to PC makes me want to upgrade my laptop. After some extensive research i bought the 7567 second-hand for its main features, which is the big battery and the subwoofer. Those features is rare for a budget gaming laptop and i love the 7567 for it, which is a shame since This is a good laptop but because of all the minor issues/flaws I encountered, I focused mainly on the cons of the laptop. My criticisms of the this laptop: The laptop itself seems to pick up the oils from your fingers easily. I only had to touch it once and there were fingerprints on it. If my hands are dry, it won't leave a trace but even the slightly amount of oil/sweat will leave a mark. It only affects the aesthetics appearance so I don't have much problem with this. The internal. The new HP Envy x360 13 that came out today ( https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-5nx63av-1 (https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-5nx63av-1)) has Precision Touchpad drivers (without a hack). Here's to hoping that this Fall's Spectre x360 follows. 
I've been looking for a decent device for the past month and the Asus Zenbook 13 UX333 absolutely crushes the price range it is in. I wasn't able to find much competition other than a HP Envy 13 which still didn't seem like it could take on the Zenbook. I have a few questions I'd like to ask: 1) Do the touchpad and WiFi work out of the box? 2) Does the WiFi drivers currently available for it support 5GHz WiFi? 3) Does the battery life hold up as good as Windows 10 after configuration Total budget and country of purchase: Unlimited budget, United States Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I am looking for a 15 inch Windows 2-in-1 that will last at least 3 years and has as few as possible known flaws or quality control issues. From my previous experience with laptops, I would like to prioritize repairability/upgradeability and thermal performance over other features. Hello, I recently bought a Dell laptop (inspiron 15 3000 3567-a30p), it's a quite good device, the only thing that is been bothering me is the touchpad, I work with design and I often use the pen tool on adobe illustrator, I like to drag the anchors with two fingers to make a more precise positioning of the lines for my drawings, but when I try to do so with the touchpad of this laptop it either just doesn't moves when I try to use another finger OR it just releases the anchor point. 
I apologize for the wall of text or if this post breaks any rules. Also if the formatting is awful or I write too much I apologize. amp#x200B; So I'm a freshman CS major looking for a laptop that's thin and light, and preferably will last me at least through uni and hopefully longer. Probably won't be using for much more than browsing, vidoes, movies, and coding; possibly will be playing some light games but nothing super graphically intensive (at least not that I can foresee). I'm happy to say that I have finally figured out how to get the precision touchpad working again on my 2017 Spectre x360 after build 1803 was rolled out! This is mostly in response to this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/a799r6/reenabling_precision_touchpad_on_hp_spectre_x360/) but may work for other systems as well. BACKGROUND: I realized the root cause of this issue is that Synaptics rolled out an update to the touchpad driver that Windows Update now picks I just installed Deepin on several of my machines. Most seem to work fine except for one HP laptop. This is a HP Elitebook 8440P. I got Deepin 15.9.3 installed. The issue is when I close the LID and the laptop goes into suspension mode. When I open the laptop screen again, I get a blank screen. Deepin appears to be running but it is just a blank screen. The only way I can get Deepin back is by power cycle it. Here are my specs: \-Computer- Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) </p>
